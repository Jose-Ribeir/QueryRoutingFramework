Figure 7: Main idea of SmoothQuant when α is 0.5. The smoothing factor s is obtained on cal-
ibration samples and the entire transformation is performed offline. At runtime, the activations
are smooth without scaling.[29]

This formula ensures that the weights and activations at the corresponding channel share a
similar maximum value, thus sharing the same difficulty[29]. Figure 7 illustrates the smoothing
