RAGCache retrieves tensors by performing prefix matching along these paths. If a subsequent document in a sequence cannot be found among the child nodes, the traversal is terminated, and the longest identified document sequence is returned. This method ensures efficiency with a time complexity of O(h), where h is the height of the tree.
