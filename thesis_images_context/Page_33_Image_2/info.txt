magnitude have on the model performance, this was done by pruning 1% of the values (accord-
ing to their magnitude) in the weights into 0 and see the perplexity results.

Table 5: PPL results after pruning 1% weight with different magnitude [22]
Based on Table 5 [22] shows that the largest magnitude outliers imposed the same influence
